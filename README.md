# Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Aryan Kumar.

I'm a Computer Science major and AI minor at Cornell University. I'm a passionate tech enthusiast who loves combining creativity and problem-solving to solve everyday problems. My interests are Artificial Intelligence (ML & NLP), Software Engineering, and Data Science. When Iâ€™m not coding, youâ€™ll probably find me hiking scenic trails, running by the lake, watching anime or playing the piano.
